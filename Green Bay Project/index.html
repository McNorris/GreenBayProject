   <p>Rodgers broke his collarbone on Oct. 15 in Minnesota. He had surgery to repair the injury five days later.
     The Packers revealed right away that the injury could be season-ending. McCarthy said Rodgers is back in Green Bay and working through rehab.
     The QB remains on injured reserve. Team physician Dr. Pat McKenzie gave McCarthy a “full, detailed look” at everything related to Rodgers’ injury on Tuesday morning.
     The Packers have not commented publicly on his recovery timeline. Rodgers must be on IR for at least eight weeks before returning.
     McCarthy said last week that Rodgers missing the season would be a “worst-case scenario.”<br>
     Either way, Packer fans are hoping that Rodgers injury heals without any complications.
     Picking up a few wins before Rodgers' return would be a huge boost to the Packers chance at winning the division let alone making the playoffs.
